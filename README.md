Tic Tac Toe 2.0

**************************Tic-Tac-Toe*******************************

We want to bring the pen-and-paper game Tic-tac-toe to the digital age,
but with a little twist: the size of the playfield should be
configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. And we also want the symbols
(usually O and X) to be configurable. Also it should be for 3 players
instead of just 2.
General Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
The two users will play against each other and against the computer.
Who is starting is random. In and output should be on the console.
After each move, the new state of the playfield is displayed and the
player can enter the next position of their character one after
another. The next position should be provided in a format like 3,2.
Invalid inputs are expected to be handled appropriately.
